The workshops and discussions will be held at the incredible Beaver Run Resort in Breckenridge, CO. The Resort is actually on the mountain, which means you can ski/board and come directly into the epic workshops!

Getting to Breckenridge from Denver International Airport is gorgeous drive west from the plains into the heart of the Rockies. Closer to the event we will provide a carpooling sheet. Carpooling with epic strangers is an amazing way to become epic friends. Renting a car is an effective way up the mountain, as long as you feel comfortable driving in potential winter weather. The other option is the Epic Mountain Express. <a href="https://www.epicmountainexpress.com/breckenridge-shuttles" target="_blank">https://www.epicmountainexpress.com/breckenridge-shuttles</a> Prices range from $59-$79 one way.

FAQ
          </h3>

            <h4 class="c-details-section__sub-title">
Do we need a laptop for the workshops?
            </h4>
            <p>
If you want to follow along and design as you learn, then definitely bring your laptop and charger!
            </p>
            <h4 class="c-details-section__sub-title">
Do I need to know how to ski/board
            </h4>
            <p>
Absolutely not! Breckenridge is an incredible place to learn with terrain for all levels!
            </p>
            <h4 class="c-details-section__sub-title">
Are lift tickets included?
            </h4>
            <p>
We aren’t providing lift tickets, but there will be a sign up sheet closer to the event so we can get a group discount!
            </p>
            <h4 class="c-details-section__sub-title">
What if I don’t want to ski/board?
            </h4>
            <p>
Breckenridge is one of the best mountain towns in Colorado, with plenty of amazing restaurants, a wonderful downtown, there is plenty to explore. You can book a tubbing session where you slide down a course on a giant inner-tube or you can go snowshoeing and explore the amazing forests! This is also why we're offering some hands-on workshops for those that want to stay at the venue.
            </p>
            <h4 class="c-details-section__sub-title">
How should I pack?
            </h4>
            <p>
Breckenridge can get pretty chilly, so a warm weatherproof jacket is essential, along with gloves, a hat/beanie, and wool socks.
            </p>
            <p>
If you are skiing/boarding and don’t have snow gear, you can rent all you need on the mountain at a few locations in Breckenridge. If you need this option (jacket, pants, gloves, goggles), please rent earlier rather than the day of so you aren’t stuck without the gear you need.
